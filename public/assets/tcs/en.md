# Terms of Use
## 1. Introduction
The Toby application (hereinafter referred to as "the Application") uses Google Drive as storage space to manage user data and includes an optional feature to send emails to the tax collection center via Gmail. The Application is specifically designed to facilitate the declaration of taxes on stock transactions, but its responsibility is strictly limited to providing this tool.
## 2. Acceptance of Terms
By using the Application, the user agrees to these terms of use. If the user does not accept these terms, they must refrain from using the Application. These terms may be modified at any time, and the user will be informed of significant changes.
## 3. Use of Google Drive and Gmail
The Application accesses only its dedicated storage space on Google Drive (“appData”). It cannot view or modify other user files. The use of Gmail is optional and requires explicit user authorization. This authorization only allows sending emails from the user’s outbox, without access to their messages or content.
## 4. Personal Data Protection
The Application does not store any personal data of users beyond what is stored in the Google Drive ecosystem, under the user's exclusive control. The Application's source code is available to everyone upon request to ensure transparency.
## 5. User Responsibility
The user is solely responsible for verifying the information entered in the declaration file, the bank transfer data, and the content of emails sent via the Application. The Application is free to use and provided "as is," without any guarantees of any kind. Under no circumstances shall the Application or its developer be held liable for errors or omissions in the data transmitted to the tax collection center.
## 6. Prohibited Use
The user agrees to:
Not use the Application for illegal purposes or in violation of these terms.
Not attempt to alter or hack the Application or its features.
## 7. Intellectual Property
All rights related to the Application (except for user content) are the exclusive property of the developer. Use of the Application does not confer any intellectual property rights to the user.
## 8. Claims and Disputes
In case of issues related to the use of the Application, the user can contact the developer to report their concern. Any claims or disputes will be governed by the laws in effect in the developer's country of origin.
## 9. Modification and Termination
The Application may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. The user may stop using the Application at any time. By using the Toby application, you agree to comply with these terms. If you have any questions, please contact the developer for more information.
